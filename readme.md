# Linpack Benchmarks

Fortran and C code is copyright 2008 by Jack Dongarra.

All of the code here (except for Makefiles) is from https://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/f_src/linpack_bench/linpack_bench.html and is **unmodified**, with https://netlib.org/benchmark/ being the original source.

The purpose of this repository is to hold some compiled binaries, and some results.
